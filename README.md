## Sorting in C++

**Sorting** is the process of arranging data in a specific order, typically ascending or descending. Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science because it optimizes the efficiency of other algorithms, such as searching, merging, and data analysis.

### 1️⃣ Classification of Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms can be classified based on:

1. **Time Complexity** – Performance in best, average, and worst cases.
2. **Space Complexity** – Memory usage during execution.
3. **Stability** – Whether equal elements retain their relative order.
4. **Method** – Comparison-based or non-comparison-based.

| Algorithm      | Time Complexity (Worst) | Stability | Method           |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Bubble Sort    | O(n²)                   | Stable    | Comparison-based |
| Selection Sort | O(n²)                   | Unstable  | Comparison-based |
| Insertion Sort | O(n²)                   | Stable    | Comparison-based |
| Merge Sort     | O(n log n)              | Stable    | Divide & Conquer |
| Quick Sort     | O(n²) (Avg O(n log n))  | Unstable  | Divide & Conquer |

### 2️⃣ Descriptions of Common Sorting Algorithms

#### **1. Bubble Sort**

* **Type:** Stable, Comparison-based
* **Complexity:** O(n²)
* **Working:** Repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Largest elements “bubble up” to the end in each pass.
* **Use Case:** Simple datasets, educational purposes.

#### **2. Selection Sort**

* **Type:** Unstable, Comparison-based
* **Complexity:** O(n²)
* **Working:** Finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning.
* **Use Case:** When memory writes are costly (fewer swaps).

#### **3. Insertion Sort**

* **Type:** Stable, Comparison-based
* **Complexity:** O(n²)
* **Working:** Builds a sorted portion of the array by inserting each new element into its correct position.
* **Use Case:** Small datasets or nearly sorted arrays.

#### **4. Merge Sort**

* **Type:** Stable, Divide & Conquer
* **Complexity:** O(n log n)
* **Working:** Recursively divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and merges them.
* **Use Case:** Sorting linked lists or large datasets.

#### **5. Quick Sort**

* **Type:** Unstable, Divide & Conquer
* **Complexity:** O(n²) worst, O(n log n) average/best
* **Working:** Chooses a pivot, partitions the array such that elements less than the pivot go left, greater go right, and recursively sorts partitions.
* **Use Case:** General-purpose, in-place sorting for large arrays.

### 3️⃣ Algorithm Outlines

#### **Quick Sort Algorithm**

1. Choose a pivot (commonly the last element).
2. Partition the array:

   * Initialize `i = low - 1`.
   * Traverse from `low` to `high - 1`.
   * If `arr[j] < pivot`, increment `i` and swap `arr[i]` with `arr[j]`.
3. Place pivot at its correct position: swap `arr[i+1]` with `arr[high]`.
4. Recursively sort left (`low` to `pi-1`) and right (`pi+1` to `high`) partitions.
5. Base case: Stop when `low >= high`.

#### **Selection Sort Algorithm**

1. Start from the first element of the array.
2. For each index `i` (0 to size-2):

   * Assume `arr[i]` is the minimum.
   * Traverse the unsorted portion to find a smaller element.
   * Swap `arr[i]` with the minimum element found.

#### **Bubble Sort Algorithm**

1. Repeat for `i = 0` to `size-2`:

   * Compare adjacent elements `arr[j]` and `arr[j+1]`.
   * Swap if `arr[j] > arr[j+1]`.
2. After each pass, largest element moves to the end.
3. Stop after `size-1` passes or earlier if no swaps occur.

### 4️⃣ Key Observations and Comparisons

| Feature                | Bubble Sort / Selection Sort / Insertion Sort    | Merge Sort / Quick Sort            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |

| Stability              | Stable (Bubble, Insertion), Unstable (Selection) | Merge: Stable, Quick: Unstable     |
| Memory Usage           | Low                                              | Merge: Extra O(n), Quick: In-place |

### 5️⃣ Conclusion

* **Simple algorithms** (Bubble, Selection, Insertion):

  * Easy to implement and understand.
  * Inefficient for large datasets due to O(n²) complexity.
* **Efficient algorithms** (Merge, Quick):

  * Significantly better for large datasets (O(n log n)).
  * **Quick Sort** is in-place and generally faster but can degrade to O(n²) in the worst case.
  * **Merge Sort** guarantees O(n log n) performance and is stable, making it ideal for linked lists or when element order matters.

Mastering these algorithms is essential for understanding optimization, time-space trade-offs, and algorithmic thinking in C++.
